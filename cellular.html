	<div class="section"><h1>Cellular systems and lattice models</h1>
<p>Provides an interesting continuum between non-living (such as molecules in crystal and metalline structures) and living (such as cells of a multi-cellular organism). The main difference is that, although both begin with more or less &#39;the same program&#39;, in living material the individual behavior of each cell specializes according to early conditions. This is important for <em>developmental biology</em>. Of course, computational cellular systems are far, far simpler than biological cells; but still draw from this inpsiration. The CA model was propsed by Stanislaw Ulam and used by von Neumann to demonstrate machines that can reproduce themselves; a more concise example being proposed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iDc4C6vbcc">Christopher Langton</a> decades later, itself later <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbpoTZlNTiw&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen">improved upon using artificial evolutionary techniques</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interciencia.es/PDF/WikipediaBooks/CellAutomata.pdf">The wikibooks on CA</a>.</p>
<p>The essential components that define a cellular system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cellular space:</strong> A collection of cells arranged into a discrete lattice, such as a 2D grid. </li>
<li><strong>Cell states:</strong> The information representing the current condition of a cell. In <em>Game of Life</em> this is either 0 or 1, but in other systems the state could be represented by an n-tuple of values, or something more complex. The set of possible states could be defined as finite or unbounded.</li>
<li><strong>Initial conditions:</strong> What state the cells are in at the start of the simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Neighborhood:</strong> The set of adjacent/nearby cells that can directly influence a particular cell. In <em>Game of Life</em> these are the 8 side and corner neighbors (the <em>Moore</em> neighborhood). In other systems it could be expressed as a radius or range.</li>
<li><strong>State transition function:</strong> The rule that a cell follows to update its state, which depends on the current state and the state of the neighborhood.</li>
<li><strong>Time axis:</strong> The cells are generally updated in a discrete fashion, which may be synchronous (all cells update simultaneously) or asynchronous (cells update separately, e.g. in a probabilistic manner).</li>
<li><strong>Boundary conditions:</strong> What happens to cells at the edges. A periodic boundary &#39;wraps around&#39; to the opposite edge; a static boundary always has the same state, a copying or reflective boundary mirrors the neighbor state, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cellular automata</h2>
<p>The mathematical notion of <em>automaton</em> indicates a discrete-time system with finite set of possible states, a finite number of inputs, a finite number of outputs, and a transition rule which gives the state at the next step in terms of the state and inputs at the previous step.</p>
<p>A <em>CA</em> applies this notion to a cellular space. It has discrete time, finite neighborhood (inputs), finite state set (often represented as integers) and synchronous update. The transition rule (or CA rule) is usually deterministic, giving a cell state[t+1] as a function of the states[t] of itself and neighbours; and all cells use the same transition rule. </p>
<p>The space itself is usually 1D, 2D or 3D, but rarely greater. Wolfram performed most of his research using 1D CAs, such as the &#39;rule 30&#39; CA below, whose evolution bears similarities with some shell patterns. The most famous CA <em>Game of Life</em> is 2D, which is so popular that people have written <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94">Turing machines</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8">Game of Life</a> in terms of it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNypW-aSCmE">Over here a 3D cellular automaton is taking over Minecraft</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBXO_6Jn1fs">here is a self-replicating computer in 3D</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/ca_shells.jpg" alt="Evolution of a 1D CA: rule 30"></p>
<p>Wolfram divided CA into four classes, according to their long-term behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class 1</strong> - stable. Evolves to homogeneous state.</li>
<li><strong>Class 2</strong> - cyclic. Evolves to simple separated periodic structures. Local changes to the initial pattern tend to remain local</li>
<li><strong>Class 3</strong> - chaotic. Any stable structures that appear are quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise. Local changes to the initial pattern tend to spread indefinitely</li>
<li><strong>Class 4</strong> - complex. Local changes to the initial pattern may spread indefinitely. Wolfram has conjectured that many, if not all class 4 cellular automata are capable of universal computation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conway&#39;s Game of Life</h3>
<p>The <em>Game of Life</em> CA is an example of a <em>outer totalistic</em> CA: The spatial directions of cells do not matter, only the total value of all neighbors is used, along with the current value of teh cell itself. The transition rule for a cell can be stated concisely as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the current state is 1 (&quot;alive&quot;):<ul>
<li>If the neighbor total is less than 2: New state is 0 (&quot;death by loneliness&quot;)</li>
<li>Else if the neighbor total is greater than 3: New state is 0 (&quot;death by overcrowding&quot;)</li>
<li>Else: State remains the same (&quot;alive&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the current state is 0 (&quot;dead&quot;):<ul>
<li>If the neigbor total is exactly 3: New state is 1 (&quot;reproduction&quot;)</li>
<li>Else: State remains the same (&quot;dead&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, in Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-lua"><span class="keyword">if</span> state == <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">then</span>
    <span class="comment">-- currently alive</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> neighbors &lt; <span class="number">2</span> <span class="keyword">then</span>
        <span class="comment">-- death by loneliness</span>
        state = <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="keyword">elseif</span> neighbors &gt; <span class="number">3</span> <span class="keyword">then</span>
        <span class="comment">-- death by overcrowding</span>
        state = <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>
    <span class="comment">-- currently dead</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> neighbors == <span class="number">3</span> <span class="keyword">then</span>
        <span class="comment">-- birth by reproduction</span>
        state = <span class="number">1</span>
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The Game of Life produces easily recognizable higher-level formations including stable objects, oscillatory objects, mobile objects and objects that produce or consume others, for example, which have been called &#39;ponds&#39;, &#39;gliders&#39;, &#39;eaters&#39;, &#39;glider guns&#39; and so on. In Wolfram&#39;s terms, it is <em>Class 4</em> CA.</p>
<p>Note that these rules mean that the Game of Life is not reversible: from a given state it is not possible to determine the previous state.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>If the cells are densely packed into a regular lattice structure, such as a 2D grid, they can efficiently be represented as <em>array</em> memory blocks. The state of a cell can be represented by a number, so an array of integers works well. A way to index this array memory to read or write a cell coordinate will be useful.</p>
<p>In theory the transition rule can be represented as a <em>look-up table</em>, however above a certain number of states and neighbors the size of this table would become astronomical (k states raised to the power of k neighbor states raised to the power of n neighbors; for a 3-state, 3-neighbor system this requires 7 billon rules!), so a procedural implementation is preferable. CAs may use bit-wise operators to implement the transition rules in a hardware-optimized way, but we will use regular <code>if</code> statements, like the above, for clarity. </p>
<p>One complication is that the states of the whole lattice must update synchronously. That means: when one cell changes, all cells should change. This is not easy to achieve in most computing systems today, which mostly follow instructions one at a time (with only limited parallelism). A naive implementation will thus update cells one at a time, and the neighborhood of a particular cell will contain both &#39;past&#39; and &#39;future&#39; states. One way to work around this is to maintain two copies of the lattice; one for the &#39;past&#39; states, and one for the &#39;future&#39; states. The transition rule always reads from the &#39;past&#39; lattice, and always writes to the &#39;future&#39; lattice. After all cells are updated, either the &#39;future&#39; is copied to the &#39;past&#39;, or the &#39;future&#39; and &#39;past&#39; lattices are swapped, since the future of yesterday is the past of tomorrow. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This technique is called <em>double-buffering</em>, and is widely used in software systems where a parallel process interacts with a serial machine. It is used to render graphics to the screen, for example.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>
<h3>Non-homogenous CA</h3>
<p>The rule is not the same for all cells / for all time steps. Spatial non-homogeneity can be interesting to simulate different geographies (such as boundaries). Temporal non-homogeneity can be used to perform a sequence of different filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Special <em>boundary</em> cells in the field may follow different rules from others.</li>
<li>Some rules may depend on the cell position; perhaps the same CA has different regions using different rules.</li>
<li>The rules used could alternate between different rule definitions, over a period of N frames. Or certain parameters to rules could cycle over certain periods.</li>
<li>The neighborhood selection rules could change spatially or temporally as above (also see particle CA below).</li>
<li>Variations of space/rule/neighborhood could depend on global conditions, such as the overall density of black and white cells, or due to user interactions.</li>
<li>Combinations of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be implemented by changing the function used in the transition rule, or by extending the state set to accommodate the differences. Changing the function is usually easier to implement and understand.</p>
<h3>Probabilistic/Stochastic CA</h3>
<p>In this case the transition rule is not deterministic, but includes some random factor. </p>
<ul>
<li>A probability can be assigned to each successor state according to the prior states. </li>
<li>A <em>backround noise</em> can be added, such that from time to time a randomly chosen cell changes state. A <em>temperature</em> control could control the statistical frequency of such changes.</li>
<li>Combinations with non-homogenous CAs: statistical choice of rules and neighborhoods; variations of probabilities over space and time, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct753/blob/master/ca_2D_forest_fire.lua">Forest Fire CA example</a>, and try changing the probabilities to see how it behaves.</p>
<h3>Particle CA, Lattice-Gas Automata and Block Rule CA</h3>
<p>The cell states represent the presence (or absence) of particles in a cell, and transition rules represent how particles move across cells. Generally the transition rule must preserve the quantity of particles. The elementary 1D traffic CA (rule 184) is a simple particle CA. </p>
<p>An implementation option is to use <em>block rules</em>, which consider small regions at a time, rather than individual cells; e.g. a 2x2 region of cells in a 2D CA (the <em>Margolus neighborhood</em>). To handle the boundaries between blocks, the regions are shifted between each application (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cellular_automaton">see wikipedia</a>). </p>
<p><img src="img/mnhood.gif" alt="Margolus neigborhood"></p>
<p>Note that a block rule CA does not need to be implemented with two buffers, since each block updates synchronously internally, and independently externally.</p>
<p>More example block CAs <a href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/rullex_marg.html">here</a> -- many of these are implemented <a href="https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct753/blob/master/ca_2D_block_rules.lua">in the example script here</a>. </p>
<p>In 1969, German computer pioneer (and painter) Konrad Zuse published his book <a href="ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/zuserechnenderraum.pdf">Calculating Space</a>, proposing that the physical laws of the universe are discrete by nature, and that the entire universe is the output of a deterministic computation on a single cellular automaton. This became the foundation of the field of study called <em>digital physics</em>. Zuse&#39;s first model is a 3D particle CA.</p>
<p><img src="img/zuse.jpg" alt="Zuse&#39;s vision of nature"></p>
<p>Particle CA can use probabilistic rules to simulate brownian motions and other non-deterministic media (but the rules would usually still need to be matter/energy preserving). Particle CA benefit from the inclusion of boundaries and other spatial non-homogeneities such as influx and outflow of particles at opposite edges.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous CA</h3>
<p>Instead of updating all cells at once, update one cell at a time, according to some update policy. The same choices can be applied per-block in a block-rule CA.</p>
<ul>
<li>A fixed update policy, such as linear scan or pre-determined path, is orderly, but may introduce artifacts (related to the <em>double-buffering</em> pattern). </li>
<li>A <em>probabilistic asynchronous CA</em> chooses the next active cell according to a random selection (related to the Monte Carlo methods described below).</li>
<li>A multi-rate CA (self-clocked) updates each cell according to a clock period that varies from cell to cell. The clock period could also be affected by neighbors, to achieve <em>entrainment</em> effects.</li>
<li>A <em>mobile CA</em> chooses a related cell (such as one of the neighbors) of the current active cell as the next active cell. So in addition to choosing a new state for the cell, the transition rule must also choose how to move the active cell. This could also be partly probabilistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>There could be more than one &#39;active cell&#39;. What happens if two active cells occupy the same site?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant">Langton&#39;s Ant</a> is a mobile CA in a 2D, two-state space, with very simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit</li>
<li>At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct753/blob/master/ca_2D_langtons_ant.lua">See the script</a> in the repo, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XQQhCgq5c">original video by Christopher Langton</a>, including examples of multiple ants (and music by the Vasulkas). Note that Langton&#39;s Ant, and other related Turmites, are closely related to the turtle graphics often used for L-systems.</p>
<p><a href="js.ants2.html">See a browser-based example here</a></p>
<h4>Statistical and unbounded state models</h4>
<p>The <em>Ising model</em> of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics can also be simulated in a <em>Monte Carlo</em> fashion. Each site (cell) has either positive or negative spin (we can encode that as 0 or 1 value). At each time step, consider a site at random, and evaluate the probability of changing state. If changing state moves the site toward energetic equilibrium with neighbors (determined according to the Hamiltonian of the site), then the change is made. Otherwise, the change is made only with a small probability that is dependent on the energetic difference and overall temperature. Thus at high temperatures, the system remains noisy, while at low temperatures it gradually self-organizes into all sites with equal spin.</p>
<p>It is also related to the <em>contact process</em> model, which has been used to simulate the spread of infection: infected sites become healthy at a constant rate, while healthy sites become infected at a rate proportional to the number infected neighbor (see also the <em>HodgePodge</em> simulation). This can be extented to multiple states for a multitype contact process. The <em>voter model</em> similarly simulates the changing of opinion in social groups. </p>
<p>The cellular <em>Potts model</em> (also known as the <em>Glazier-Graner</em> model) generalizes these to allow more than two site states, and in some cases, an unbounded number of possible site states; however it still utilizes the notion of statistical movement toward neighbor equilibrium to drive change, though the definition of a local Hamiltonian. Variations have been used to model grain growth, foam, fluid flow, chemotaxis, biological cells, and even the developmental cycle of whole organisms. Note that in this field, the term <em>cell</em> is used not to refer to a site on the lattice, but to a whole group of connected sites that share the same state. So in modeling foam, a <em>cell</em> represents a single bubble, and is made of one or more <em>sites</em>. Most changes therefore happen at the boundaries between these cells.</p>
<p>Stan Marée used this model to simulate the whole life cycle of <a href="http://www-binf.bio.uu.nl/stan/Thesis/">Dictyostelium discoideum</a>.</p>
<h3>Continuous automata</h3>
<p><strong>Continuous states:</strong> In this case, the states are not discrete but belong to a continuum, such as the linear range 0..1. Instead of using a discrete transition rule or lookup table, continuous functions can be used (or combined with discrete rules such as numeric comparisons). Continuous automata can show liquid and diffusive effects.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous neighborhood:</strong> Instead of accumulating whole neighbor cells, apply a <em>kernel</em> region. Perhaps give different weights to cells according to the degree that they fall under a radius, or by distance.</p>
<h4>SmoothLife</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69EDA11384365494">SmoothLife</a> still uses a discrete grid, but both the kernel and transition functions are adjusted for smooth, continuous values. A disc around the cell is integrated and normalized (i.e. averaged) for the cell&#39;s state, and a ring around this is integrated &amp; normalized (averaged) for the neighbor state. Cell transition functions are expressed in terms of continuous sigmoid thresholds over the [0, 1] range, and re-expressed in terms of differential functions (velocities of change) to approximate continuous time. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1567v2.pdf">Paper here</a>. By doing so, it removes the discrete bias and leads to fascinating results. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7t8LtdBAV8">Another implementaton</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA857JdUn9o&amp;list=PL69EDA11384365494&amp;index=46">Taken to 3D</a>. In effect, by making all components continuous, it is essentially a simulation of differential equations.</p>
<p><a href="http://0fps.net/2012/11/19/conways-game-of-life-for-curved-surfaces-part-1/">Here is a great explanation of the SmoothLife implementation, with a jsfiddle demo</a></p>
<h4>Reaction Diffusion</h4>
<p>The reaction-diffusion model was proposed by Turing to describe embryo development and pattern-generation (<a href="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf">Turing, A. The Chemical Basic for Morphogenesis.</a>); it is still used today in CG (<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/reaction_diffusion.pdf">Greg Turk&#39;s famous paper</a>). RD systems and other differential equation systems can be approximated using continuous automata.</p>
<p><img src="img/xmorphia-parameter-map.jpg" alt="The Gray-Scott parameter map"></p>
<p>One approach to simulating RD using CA is the <em>Gray-Scott</em> model, as described in <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/patt-sol/9304003.pdf">Pearson, J. E. Complex Patterns in a Simple System</a>. There is <a href="http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/">a wonderful archive of this model at this webpage</a>, including many great video examples of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5oKgVZ6bTk">u-skate world</a>, and even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03lcPEmSOQ">u-skate in 3D</a>. An implementation in our software can be found <a href="https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct753/blob/master/ca_2D_greyscott.lua">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these systems share resemblance with analog video feedback (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDYEVv9t32U">example</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw5onuS2_mw">example</a>), which has been exploited by earlier media artists (notably the Steiner and Woody Vasulka). </p>
<h3>Multi-Scale Systems</h3>
<p>Several cellular systems can be coupled together at different scales. </p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps each cell of a macro-CA is itself an entire micro-CA world. Or several CA can overlap with different spatial relationships. </li>
<li>Different indexing rules (such as affine transformations of coordinate space) can be used to impart non-local symmetries and behavior.</li>
<li>Different rules (or different neighborhood specifications) can be run in parallel on the same shared data. </li>
<li>Higher- and lower-level systems could progress at different rates (or statistical frequencies).</li>
</ul>
<p>Artists Driessens &amp; Verstappen created a recursive cellular system (exhibited in the artwork <em>IMA Traveller</em>) which appears to show an endless zoom; as the whole field appears to expand, each cell periodically subdivides into four daughter cells, following one of several rules to vary the color. Cells outside the viewpoint are thrown away. The effect is an infinitely expanding landscape or journey, which can be partially navigated by the gallery visitor. See the <a href="http://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/ima/IMAtraveller.html">website</a> and in particular the <a href="http://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/ima/IMAcat.html">info</a> link. This work has inspired discussion by several critics, including <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/digc.14.1.43.8810">Mitchell Whitelaw</a> and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.6640&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Jon McCormack and Alan Dorin</a>.</p>
<h4>Multi-Scale Symmetric Turing Patterns</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/">Jonathan McCabe&#39;s cyclic multi-scale Turing patterns</a>, and a <a href="http://teemingvoid.blogspot.kr/2007/02/jonathan-mccabe-very-cellular-automata.html">commentary by Mitchell Whitelaw</a>. The implementation is described <a href="http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/Cyclic_Symmetric_Multi-Scale_Turing_Patterns.pdf">in this paper</a>.</p>
<p>It starts with a straightforward reaction/diffusion system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diffusion is simulated by averaging the continuous cell values over small (activator) and large (inhibitor) radii; if the the smaller (activator) concentration is greater than the larger (inhibitor) concentration, increase the cell value by a small amount; otherwise decrease. </li>
<li>After running the rule over all cells, the entire field is <em>normalized</em> (to ensure the minimum cell value is zero and the maximum cell value is 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this creates structure at a single spatial scale, it can be elaborated by super-imposing several models at different spatial scales (different small and large radii). Or, by changing the radii dynamically over time (as in <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/reaction_diffusion.pdf">Greg Turk&#39;s famous paper</a>). McCabe&#39;s system uses several pre-defined scales, but selects which scale to apply for a particular cell according to which one currently shows the least local variation. </p>
<p>Additionally, his system does not measure all cells within a radius; instead it selects cells at the radius distance and certain angular directions, creating cyclical symmetries in the result. For example, 3-fold symmetry may be used at a smaller scale, and 9-fold symmetry at a larger scale.</p>
<h1>Assignment 1: Cellular Systems</h1>
<p>The first assignment is to construct a new cellular system. You can start from one of the existing systems we have looked at and modify it, or design and create a new one to explore an idea you have; you can look through some of the different <em>variations on cellular systems</em> above and try to implement one. You might spend roughly a third of your time choosing what to try and designing, a third actually implementing it, and a third exploring it for interesting parameters, initial conditions, rule variations etc. If you end up with more than one system that is interesting, you can submit them all. </p>
<p>If you had an idea that seemed interesting but was difficult to implement or did not lead to interesting results, submit that too (with an explanation of why you think it did not work or did not do what you expected); this is just as important a part of research (akin to disproving a hypothesis in science).</p>
<p>You can use any programming language that you prefer. However if you do not use the Lua or JavaScript frameworks provided in the class, you will need to also submit a video along with the code (in case we are unable to make it run on our machines). </p>
<p>Regardless of the language used, you must document your work using comments in the code. </p>
<p>At the top of your code, there should be comments including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>name</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>date</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>description</strong> of the idea of the system, how it works (or why it doesn&#39;t), and why it is interesting, surprising, etc (or why it didn&#39;t meet your expectations). What kinds of long-term behaviors it supports. </li>
<li>A description of any <strong>interactions</strong> it supports (what the mouse does, what key presses do)</li>
<li>A description of the <strong>technical realization</strong>. (Perhaps you tried a few different algorithms until it worked as expected?) If you were inspired by another system, mention it.</li>
<li>Ideas for possible <strong>future extensions</strong> of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also comment all the important operations in the code. Please also try to use helpful variable names, e.g. <code>width</code> is more communicative than <code>var3</code>.</p>
<p>Send your final project code to the TA, on or before <strong>Friday 28 March</strong>.  </p>
<p>Your assignment will be evaluted by these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical completeness</strong> (33%). If it works, how well it works (efficiency, accuracy). Also how clearly the code is structured and commented. Even if it doesn&#39;t work, how well it was conceived and implemented. </li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic qualities</strong> (33%). How interesting the appearances and behaviors are. Perhaps the system behaves differently for different initial conditions or variations in rules and parameters; spend some time finding good start conditions and include them as options in the program (e.g. triggered by pressing keys). Write down how to use them, and why you think they are interesting. If it doesn&#39;t work as expected or produce interesting results, then the evaluation here will be on how well you can articulate what you had hoped for, what aspects of that you think are missing, why you think they are missing, what you can suggest to resolve it, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Novel contribution</strong> (33%). This means creating something that we haven&#39;t built together in class, perhaps even something that has never been made before. The key aspects here are the creative qualities of the idea. Your ideas for future extensions will be evaluated too.</li>
