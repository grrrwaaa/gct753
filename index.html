<p>KAIST GSCT Spring 2013<br>Instructor: Dr. Graham Wakefield (<a href="http://www.grahamwakefield.net">grrrwaaa@gmail.com</a>)<br>Hours: Tue/Thu 10:30 - 12:00<br>Location: N25 3239<br>Office hours: Wed 11am-12pm, 2pm-3pm, N25 3228
Language: English<br>Credit: 3<br>Web: <a href="http://grrrwaaa.github.com/gct753/">http://grrrwaaa.github.com/gct753/</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>How can we create cultural artifacts (art, architecture, design, service) that are as rich, adaptive, and fascinating as nature? Media computation is often presented in terms of isolated and narrow problem-solving tasks, but the culture technology of tomorrow is increasingly connected, persistent, interactive, and open-ended. How can we create media systems that respond continuously and creatively to an ever-changing environment?</p>
<p>From its origins computing has been inspired by nature, including aspects of intelligence, pattern formation, self-construction and reproduction, autonomy and collective behavior. This course introduces the key conceptual frameworks and techniques of bio-inspired computation and their applications in artifacts of cultural technology, particularly for interactive and generative media arts. The course however most strongly emphasizes practice: during the course, creative applications are examined and implemented in interactive audiovisual media. The aim is not only to develop understanding and expertise, but also to look ahead toward the artificial/natural/cultural environments of tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Theoretical issues, technical models, and exemplary works are presented in lecture sessions, and implemented during lab sessions. Students may use a software engine supplied by the instructor. Toward the end of the course lab sessions will be oriented towards helping students with their final projects. Lecture and course materials, including the software engine, will be presented and disseminated through the class web-site.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of the course, students will: </p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the many themes of bio-inspired computation, how it has been applied in generative
and interactive arts, and how it may be extrapolated into future culture technologies. </li>
<li>Be able to apply these techniques for tasks of problem-solving as well as interactive and creative
works, as demonstrated in a project portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The course is designed to be suitable to students with different levels of technical expertise, but some prior programming experience is assumed.</p>
<h3>Assignments &amp; final project</h3>
<p>Assignments must be completed individually. Collaboration is permitted for final projects, however each student must be able to clearly identify which parts of the project they were responsible for. The final project may extend existing work from one (or more) of the assignments, but will be evaluated only according to the new contributions. Final projects are selected by students, but must present an agent-environment system that integrates interactivity with  adaptation (such as evolution or learning).</p>
<p>Coursework will be delivered through <a href="https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct753">github</a>.</p>
<p>Lab sessions and assignments will utilize a software engine provided by the instructor, compatible with OSX and possibly Linux or Windows. Using a specific engine allows us to concentrate on important conceptual issues without being distracted by platform and library variations and inconsistencies. The engine supports easy experimentation by students and rapid in-class authoring examples by the instructor. The principles learned can be easily translated to other languages and systems.</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Grading will be based on: </p>
<ul>
<li>in-class participation (20%), </li>
<li>assignments (40%), and </li>
<li>final project presentation (40%). </li>
</ul>
<p>Assignment and projects will be graded according to: </p>
<ul>
<li>technical proficiency (33%), </li>
<li>aesthetic quality (33%), and </li>
<li>novel contribution (33%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>A selection of key papers will be disseminated during the course. Two books are also recommended, from which many readings will be selected: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/bio-inspired-artificial-intelligence">Floreano &amp; Mattiussi, Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computational-beauty-nature">Flake, The Computational Beauty of Nature</a></li>
</ul>
